This application lets you generate (mostly stream) collections from your osu! beatmaps.
If you hover over the variables on the left side, there's an explanation on what they do.


Thanks a lot to Haron who gave me the motivation to work on this program and helped me a lot with figuring out the algorithm.

# Requirements
- Java version 8 or above
- [CollectionManager](https://github.com/Piotrekol/CollectionManager), so you can add the generated collections to your osu! ones
- Both .jar files of this application's [latest release](https://github.com/LuzianU/OsuCollectionGenerator/releases/latest) in the same folder without having changed their name
